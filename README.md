Homework 2 - 05/0518

The assignment is not complete because I could not figure out how to get the required alignments without the more advanced layout options that I'm accustomed to using.  For the most part, I use bootstrap-like tools and some third party "widgets" that include detailed styling options/skins.  I still have to make css adjustments when I extend the tools or have special adaptation requirements.  In fact I have some specific css problems that I need to figure out for an application I am developing.  They are pretty much the same alignment problems I'm having difficulty with in this assignment.  Although interesting, I found that I was just burning time without progress.  Simply trying to get the "About me" and Navbar on the same line seemed impossible. I've tried nesting, un-nesting, re-nesting, float, flex, inline-block, inline-everything else. Honestly, I have found css to be the most frustrating facet of programming.    

I know css is important in generating an ascetically pleasing UIs.  I'll continue the project with the advanced tools for the next homework and will hopefully make a better impression.

Also, I have been asked several times about the pre-work which I have not turned in.  I did the assignments that were directly applicable to course preparation, such as configuring my computer and setting up the necessary accounts such as Github, etc. I was already in overdrive trying to complete some major projects before the program start date to reduce time conflicts during the course.  

I would like to propose that I show a sample of the project that I have been working on in lieu of the pre-work assignment.  This project is the primary reason for enrolling in the course to begin with.  My objective in taking the course is to learn the skills necessary to complete the application and to deploy, scale and maintain it on a commercial level.

Best,
Brian Laney
